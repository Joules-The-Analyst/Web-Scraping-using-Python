Web Scraping Using Python

Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. In this project, I utilized the BeautifulSoup library in Python for web scraping to extract data from Wikipedia. The objective was to compile information on the "List of clubs who have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992 to the 2024â€“25 season".
